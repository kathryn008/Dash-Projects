# Dash-Projects
This code is originally from General Assembly's Dash projects.

I wanted to save a copy of the code and tweak it for practice and learning. 

The projects are free and can be found at https://dash.generalassemb.ly/projects. I found they a fantastic refresher on basic HTML, CSS and Javascript.
